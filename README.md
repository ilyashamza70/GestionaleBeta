# GestionaleBeta
Test interface per Gestionale pizzeria con Ferri Luca.

Written in java, updates coming soon with implementation of Jbutton ActionListeneers.

Created Database Local with MySql and saved Users as utente:

details database:

Implementing now the actionperformed on the time buttons

so that when pressed they save the time in tha Ordine table

of the dataBase and then move you directly to the adress selector

Page. You can also move with the "avanti" button 

But a JDialog will open reminding if no time is selcted.

//Maybe add a number of pizza counter?
